# Control and Signal Processing 

This repository contains MATLAB scripts, calculations, and analysis related to **Control and Signal Processing (CSP)** concepts. It includes all the laboratory experiments and exercises for the **Control and Signal Processing Laboratory (ICE 3241)** course. 
The repository is structured according to the lab cycles and experiments.
